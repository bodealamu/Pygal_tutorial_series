# Pygal_tutorial_series
This repo is for my Youtube series which introduces the python Visualization library -- Pygal. Pygal is used for creating SVG images and is very ease to use as well as being customizable.<br>

Clone the repo and install the libraries in the requirements.txt file using <br><code>pip install -r requirements.txt.<br>


In the root of the folder, you can start the jupyter notebook server by running:<br>
<code>jupyter lab <br>
